### psycopg2 overview
This python package allows you to connect to a Postgre SQL (psql) server and execute queries directly in python. <br>
You'll have to manually open connections, perform transactions, and close them out manually, which can make it hard to scale to web development. <br>
It's good if you want to write low-level SQL but it easily inflates the workload.
