    <p>Tree structures allow you to organize your HTML documents into meaningful sections.</p>
    <p> 
        This is helpful for readability and to provide a consistent structure for styling and 
        programmatic control with CSS and JavaScript.

    <div>
        For this exercise, I want you to:
        <ul>
            <li>Add an h1 tag with some content.</li>
            <li>Add a div tag.</li>
            <li>Add two paragraph tags as child elements to the div.</li>
            <li>Add text content to each paragraph element.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h1>This is the main header</h1>
    <div>
        <p>This is the first paragraph</p>
        <p>This is the second paragraph</p>
    </div>
